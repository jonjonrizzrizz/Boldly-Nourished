<div class="Top-box2"><p> New to tallow? Here something you’ll want to know:
    Tallow takes a little longer to absorb into the skin and feels a bit greasy at first due to its unique
    composition and the way it interacts with your skin.
    1. Rich in Fatty Acids: Tallow is primarily made up of fatty acids, such as oleic, stearic,
    and palmitic acids, which are thicker and heavier than the lighter oils found in many other
    skincare products. These fatty acids create a barrier on the skin that locks in moisture
    and provides long-lasting hydration. This barrier can make the balm feel greasy at first,
    as it’s not absorbing as quickly as lighter oils.
    2. Mimics Skin’s Natural Oils: Tallow closely resembles the sebum (natural oils) produced
    by our skin. Because it’s so similar to what your body already produces, your skin can
    take time to fully absorb it and integrate it. This is especially true for people with oilier
    skin types, as their skin might not need as much external oil.
    3. Layer of Protection: The initial greasy feeling comes from the protective layer that
    tallow forms on the skin. While it might feel greasy at first, it’s actually doing its job by
    creating a barrier that prevents moisture loss and shields your skin from environmental
    stressors.
    <br>
    With time, the oil is gradually absorbed, and your skin is left feeling soft, nourished, and
    hydrated—without the greasiness. If you want a quicker absorption, you can also apply a
    smaller amount to avoid excess.
